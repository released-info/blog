# What is Android?

Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems in the world, with more than 2 billion active users. It was
first released in 2008 and has since gone through numerous major versions, each with its own set of features and
capabilities. It provides users with a wealth of features, including multitasking and background services, web browsing,
media playback, and location-based services. Moreover, it provides developers with a powerful platform for creating apps
for a variety of devices and platforms.
Android is an open source software stack for mobile devices including smartphones, tablets, and now wearables,
televisions, and cars. It consists of an operating system, middleware and key applications. Developed by Google and the
Open Handset Alliance, Android offers an open source platform and application framework for mobile devices.
Android is a mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel, designed primarily for touchscreen devices such as
smartphones and tablets. Google has been the primary driving force behind Android's development since it was first
released in 2007. It is now the world's most popular mobile operating system, powering more than two billion active
devices.
As a result, Android is a highly customizable platform and developers can develop apps and services for it with relative
ease. This has led to a wide variety of apps and services being available for Android, ranging from enterprise solutions
to everyday utility apps.

# History

Android was developed in response to Apple's iOS, which had become increasingly popular in the late 2000s. The Android
team was originally formed in 2003 as part of the Open Handset Alliance, which was a consortium of companies that
included Google, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, and other technology companies. In 2007, the first Android-powered device was
released: the T-Mobile G1, which was the first mass-market smartphone to feature a color display, touch screen, and GPS.
Since then, Android has grown exponentially in popularity and is now the most popular mobile operating system in the
world. It has also come to power a wide variety of devices, from smart TVs and watches, to cars and even refrigerators.
Additionally, it has been adopted by a wide variety of companies, from phone manufacturers to media giants like Sony and
Spotify.
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google and based on Linux, first released in 2008. It was initially
designed for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, but has become one of the most widely used
mobile operating systems in the world. Nowadays, Android runs on more than 2 billion devices and has the largest
installed base of any operating system.

When the original Android source code was released in 2008, the world was a different place. Google had just gone
public, the first Android phone (the G1) had yet to be released, and Apple's iPhone was just starting to make waves. But
since then, it's been a wild ride.

Since its inception, Android has grown significantly and is now the most widely used mobile platform in the world, even
surpassing Apple's iOS. Over the years, Google, along with its partners in the Open Handset Alliance, have worked hard
to improve both the core Android platform as well as the applications that run on it. The latest version of Android (
Lollipop) is particularly noteworthy, as it brings a multitude of new features and design elements to the OS.

In addition to the core OS, Google and its partners have also developed a variety of other Android-based projects. These
include the Android Wear platform for smartwatches, Android Auto for automobiles, Android TV for televisions, and
Brillo, which is intended to bring Android to the Internet of Things.

In 2003, Android Inc., was founded by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White to develop, in Rubin's
words, "smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences."

Google acquired Android Inc. in 2005 and they released the first version of the Android OS, Alpha, later that year. The
first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released on September 23, 2008. Since then, the Android operating system has
gone through multiple major releases and updates, with the current version being Android 9.0 ‘Pie’, which was released
on August 6, 2018.

# Examples of Usage

Android is used in a wide variety of scenarios, from consumer electronics to enterprise solutions. Some of the most
popular uses of Android include:

* Media streaming: Android is used by companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify to power their media streaming services.
  Additionally, it is used by TV manufacturers to create streaming capabilities for their devices.
* Mobile apps: A large majority of all the apps available on Google Play are created for Android devices. These include
  everything from games to utility and productivity apps.
* Automotive solutions: Many car manufacturers use Android to power their in-car infotainment systems. This allows them
  to offer features such as maps, music streaming, and advanced voice control.
* Home automation: Android is used by smart home devices such as thermostats, security systems, and lightbulbs, allowing
  users to control them using their phones.
* Enterprise solutions: Companies such as Salesforce, Oracle, and SAP use Android to power their enterprise solutions.
  This allows businesses to create custom solutions that run on Android devices.

# Code Example

Android applications are written primarily in the Java programming language. Here is a simple example of an Android
application that displays a “Hello World” message:

```
import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
```

This code will create an app with a single Activity (the main screen) and display a “Hello World” message. To take full
advantage of Android’s features, developers can use additional APIs, such as the Android Support Library or Google Play
Services.


Here is some sample code which demonstrates how to create an Android application:

```
public class MyActivity extends Activity {

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_my);

        // Get a handle to the button in the layout
        Button myButton = (Button)findViewById(R.id.my_button);

        // Set an OnClickListener on the button
        myButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Do something when the button is clicked
            }
        });
    }
}
```

And here is some sample code for an Android Wear application:

```
public class MyWatchActivity extends WearableActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_my_watch);

        // Get a handle to the button in the layout
        Button myButton = (Button)findViewById(R.id.my_button);

        // Set an OnClickListener on the button
        myButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Do something when the button is clicked
            }
        });
    }
}
```

The following code example shows how to create a simple application for Android using the Android SDK.

```xml

<application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
    <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
</application>
```

This example creates an application called ‘MainActivity’ which will be launched when the application is opened. It also
defines the application’s icon, label, and theme, which will be used throughout the application.

## Origins

The development of Android began in 2003, when Google acquired Android Inc., a small startup led by Andy Rubin, who had
previously been involved in the development of Danger Inc.'s T-Mobile Sidekick smartphone. The company was developing a
technology platform that would allow mobile devices to run multiple applications at once, something that was unheard of
at the time.
In 2005, Google released the Android Developer Challenge, a competition to help develop innovative applications for the
platform. The challenge saw a huge response and Google eventually awarded $1 million to the winning developers. This
helped spur further development of the Android platform and its associated tools and libraries.

## Components

The Android operating system is composed of several distinct components, each with its own purpose and function. The
main components are the Linux kernel, which provides the core functions of the operating system; the application
framework, which provides the basic structure for creating apps; and the Dalvik virtual machine, which provides a
runtime environment for running Android apps.

The Android SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to create Android
applications. The SDK contains a range of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access the
underlying hardware and software features of an Android device.

## Versions

Over the years, Google has released a number of major versions of Android, each with its own distinct features and
capabilities. The first major version, released in 2008, was Android 1.5 (Cupcake). This version introduced a number of
new features, such as support for third-party application markets and customizable home screens.

In the following years, Google released a number of new versions of Android, including Android 2.2 (Froyo); Android
3.0 (Honeycomb); Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich); Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean); Android 4.4 (KitKat); Android 5.0 (
Lollipop); Android 6.0 (Marshmallow); and Android 7.0 (Nougat). Android 8.0 (Oreo) was released in 2018, with Android
9.0 (Pie) following in 2019.

## Features

Android provides a variety of features to users, some of which are built into the operating system itself and some of
which are available through third-party application markets. Some of the most commonly used features include support for
multitasking and background services, web browsing, media playback, location-based services, voice input and output, and
notifications.

For developers, Android offers a powerful development platform that includes a wide range of APIs and libraries,
allowing them to easily create applications for a variety of devices and platforms. Android also supports a wide range
of programming languages, including Java, C++, Kotlin, and HTML5.

## Examples of Usage

### Android Apps

The core of Android is built around applications, or apps, that allow users to do everything from checking news and
weather to playing games and streaming movies and music. As of 2015, there were over 1.5 million apps available in the
Google Play store, making it one of the largest app stores in the world.

Developers who wish to create apps for Android can do so using Java or Kotlin, and tools such as the Android Software
Development Kit (SDK). The SDK provides all of the necessary tools to build, test, and deploy apps for Android devices.

### Android Wear

Android Wear is a version of Android that has been specifically designed to run on wearable devices such as
smartwatches. It is based on the same Android OS as mobile devices, but has been modified to fit the form factor and
provide a different experience.

The main differences between Android Wear and the regular version of Android are the interface and the types of apps
that can be installed. Android Wear is focused on providing quick glances at information and controlling other devices,
while regular Android phones are better suited for more in-depth interactions and activities.

### Android Auto

Android Auto is an in-car connectivity system based on a modified version of Android. It is designed to make it easy for
drivers to access their favorite apps and services while driving, such as phone calls, navigation, music, and messaging.

Android Auto works by connecting an Android device to a compatible car dashboard. When connected, the car's dashboard
will display Android Auto's user interface, allowing drivers to access apps and services without taking their eyes off
the road. Additionally, compatible apps have been optimized for use with Android Auto, allowing for a more seamless
experience.

### Android TV

Android TV is a version of Android designed specifically for use on television sets. Like with Android Wear, it is based
on the same Android OS as phones and tablets, but has been optimized for use on a bigger screen.

Android TV runs on a variety of platforms, including smart TVs, set-top boxes, and game consoles. Users can access
popular streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, as well as a plethora of other apps and games.
Additionally, several manufacturers have created Android TV-powered streaming sticks and boxes, allowing users to turn
any TV into a Smart TV.

### Brillo

Google recently unveiled Brillo, a platform designed to bring Android to the Internet of Things. Brillo is based on a
modified version of Android and is intended to make it easier for developers to create applications for connected
devices.

Brillo is designed to be lightweight, so that it can be used on devices such as connected light bulbs and door locks.
Access to some of Android's core components, such as the Activity Manager, is not included, but the platform does come
with support for Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi.

## Key Components

Android is split into four main components:

* **Linux Kernel** - Android relies on the Linux kernel for core system services such as security, memory management,
  process management, network stack, and driver model.

* **Android Runtime (ART)** - ART is the primary runtime which replaces Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) which is used in
  earlier versions of Android. ART is a cross-platform runtime which supports the compilation and execution of multiple
  programming languages.

* **Libraries** - It includes a set of C/C++ core libraries which are exposed to developers through the Android
  application framework. These libraries provide most of the functionality available in the core libraries of Java
  language.

* **Application Framework** - This layer provides abstractions for core mobile device functionality such as audio,
  locations, graphics, data storage etc. Application framework enables high-level access to various device capabilities
  and its services which make it easier for developers to write applications.

## Adoption

Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system with over 2 billion active users worldwide. It is largely
used on smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It is also used on televisions, cars, and even wristwatches.

The majority of Android usage falls into the categories of:

* **Communication** - Android devices are used as a tool for communication, with applications such as WhatsApp, Viber,
  Skype and Hangouts.
