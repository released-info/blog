# Introduction to Erlang

Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system. It was
originally developed by Ericsson as a proprietary language to be used for telecommunications applications. It was
released as open source in 1998 and has since become one of the most popular languages for developing distributed
systems.

Erlang has its own virtual machine, the Erlang Virtual Machine (EVM), which builds on the functionality of the
conventional virtual machine by adding support for message passing, soft real-time garbage collection, and
multi-threading. The language also features high scalability, fault tolerance and hot code loading.

The language can be used in many different contexts, including web services, distributed applications,
telecommunication, and gaming. It is also popular for use in areas such as artificial intelligence and natural language
processing.

Erlang is a general-purpose programming language and concurrent runtime environment used in many applications and
industries. It was originally developed by Ericsson in 1987 and released as open source in 1998. The language is best
known for its low-level abstractions, scalability, fault-tolerance, distributed processing capabilities, and real-time
performance. It is often used in telecoms, finance, gaming, and ecommerce applications.

## History of Erlang

Erlang was developed in 1986 by Joe Armstrong at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. Originally, it was used for
programming telephone switching systems, such as AXE (the first commercial system to run the new software).

In 1998, Ericsson released Erlang as open source software. The language quickly gained interest from developers,
especially those looking for fault tolerance, scalability, and performance when building large-scale applications.

Since then it has been used by organizations such as WhatsApp, Amazon, Facebook, and the BBC. In 2018, Erlang was
accepted into the Code Mesh conference as an official language.

Erlang is a general-purpose functional programming language created by Joe Armstrong and Robert Virding in 1986. It has
gained a lot of attention in recent years, due to its ability to construct highly performant distributed systems. Erlang
has been used in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, industrial control, and many other sectors.

## Origins

Erlang was originally created as a language for creating telecommunications software. Joe Armstrong, one of the creators
of Erlang, was working for Ericsson in Stockholm. Armstrong and his team wanted to create a language that could easily
be adapted to different types of telecommunications equipment and protocols. The resulting language was Erlang.

The language was designed to be reliable and fault-tolerant. This meant that a system written in Erlang would be able to
withstand any single point of failure and still continue to operate. This made it an ideal choice for developing
telecoms software.

## Features of Erlang

Erlang is known for its scalability, fault tolerance, and concurrency. The language has a number of features that make
it ideal for creating reliable, distributed systems.

### Concurrency

Erlang provides processes that are isolated from each other, allowing programs to be written as sets of processes that
communicate with each other. This means that multiple complex operations can be running in parallel, making Erlang ideal
for distributed systems.

### Fault Tolerance

Erlang has built-in error detection and crash recovery mechanisms, making it well-suited to creating fault-tolerant
applications.

### Scalability

Erlang allows for distributed applications to scale easily. It uses a distributed process model to allow for efficient
scaling to hundreds or even thousands of nodes.

## Erlang Use Cases

Erlang is widely used in many different contexts, ranging from web services to gaming. Here are some of the use cases:

### Web Services

Erlang is used by several major web services, such as WhatsApp, Amazon, and Facebook. It is well-suited for handling
large numbers of simultaneous connections, as well as providing high availability.

### Telecommunications

Erlang was initially developed for use in the telecommunications industry. Its features make it well-suited for
applications such as call routing, billing systems, and messaging platforms.

### Gaming

Erlang is used in the development of online games. Its scalability and fault tolerance make it a great choice for
creating online gaming platforms that can support thousands of players.

### Artificial Intelligence

Erlang is used in artificial intelligence applications, such as natural language processing. Its support for concurrency
makes it well-suited for tasks such as language translation and speech recognition.

## Features

Erlang offers many features that make it an attractive language for many developers.

One of the most notable features of Erlang is its support for concurrent programming. Erlang supports lightweight
process threads, which can run in parallel without interfering with each other. This makes it much easier to develop
programs that can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.

Erlang also has strong error handling capabilities. When an error occurs, the process is stopped and restarted from a
checkpoint. This allows for rapid debugging and prevents errors from cascading through a system.

Erlang also supports hot code swapping. This allows changes to be made to a system while it is running. This reduces the
amount of time spent on testing and debugging, as well as reducing the time needed to make changes to a system.

Finally, Erlang has a robust set of libraries for creating distributed systems. These libraries allow developers to
create powerful and reliable distributed systems, such as those found in telecoms and banking applications.

Erlang is a concurrent, functional language designed to support soft real-time, distributed applications. It has a wide
range of powerful features that make it ideal for developing apps that require scalability and reliability, as outlined
below:

- The language has built-in support for soft real-time applications, allowing developers to constrain the resources that
  an application can use.
- It enables distributed computing, which allows tasks to be partitioned into separate nodes running on different
  computers across a network.
- It supports hot code loading, allowing developers to instantly update an application without having to restart it.
- Erlang has built-in support for fault tolerance, providing developers with mechanisms to detect, isolate, and repair
  errors quickly.
- It offers asynchronous message communication and non-block process communication, which helps to ensure scalability
  and reliability.
- It is a garbage collected language, which means it reclaims unused memory automatically, reducing the need for manual
  memory management.

## Advantages

Erlang has many advantages over other programming languages. These include:

- Fault tolerance - Erlang has a unique message-passing architecture that allows it to gracefully recover from
  unexpected failures. This makes it particularly suited for distributed systems and critical applications where
  downtime or data loss needs to be minimized.

- Fast development - Erlang is a high-level language that allows for fast development. It also comes with an extensive
  library of pre-built functions and modules that can be reused and customized for specific projects.

- Flexible and extensible - Erlang can be extended with C and C++ libraries, making it extremely flexible and allowing
  developers to build on top of existing code.

- Scalable - Erlang is designed from the ground up to be highly scalable. There are no hard limits on how many
  concurrent processes can be running on an Erlang system, making it incredibly powerful for distributed applications.

## Usage Examples

Erlang is used in a variety of applications and industries. Some of the most notable examples include:

- WhatsApp - WhatsApp is one of the world’s most popular messaging apps, and it is powered by a backend written in
  Erlang. By leveraging the language’s unique characteristics, WhatsApp has been able to quickly scale its platform to
  serve millions of users.

- RabbitMQ - RabbitMQ is an open source message broker that is used in distributed systems as an intermediary between
  different services. It is built entirely in Erlang, allowing it to take advantage of the language’s fault-tolerance
  while delivering high performance.

-module(hello_world).
-export([main/0]). 

main() ->
  io:fwrite("Hello, World!~n").
```

To run the program, type:

```shell
$ erlc hello_world.erl 
$ erl -run hello_world main
Hello, World!
```

This example will print “Hello, World!” to the console.


Erlang has been successfully used in a number of high-performance applications. Here are few examples:

- **Telecom Systems**: Erlang is used in building telecom system software, including telecom switching, mobile networks,
  and soft switches.

```erlang
add_numbers(X, Y) ->
    X + Y.
```

The following example shows how to spawn an Erlang process:

```erlang
spawn(F, A) -> 
   spawn(fun() -> F(A) end).
```

And here is an example of a program that implements a basic chat server:

```erlang
-module(chat_server).

-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    Pid = self(), 
    gen_server:start({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [Pid], []).

handle_call(_Request, _From, State) ->
    {reply, ok, State}.

handle_cast({message, From, Msg}, State) ->
    io:format("~p says ~p~n", [From, Msg]),
    {noreply, State}.
```
