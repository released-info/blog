# Introduction

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create
anything from small scripts to large enterprise applications. Haskell gained popularity in the early 2000s and has since
seen an increase in its adoption in the industry, in academia, and by hobbyists.
Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose, polymorphically statically typed, purely functional language, with
non-strict semantics and strong static typing. It is named after the logician Haskell Curry. Haskell is widely used in
academia and industry.

## History

The development of Haskell started in the late 1980s. The first version of the language, named Haskell 1.0, was released
in 1990. This was followed by successive language releases of Haskell 98 in 1998, Haskell 2010 in 2010, and most
recently Haskell 2018 in 2018.
In 2003, an open source implementation of the language, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), was released. Since then,
GHC has become the de facto standard for Haskell implementations, being actively developed and widely used in both
industry and academia.
In 2007, the Haskell community began to create the Haskell Platform for easier distribution and deployment of the
language. This platform allows users to easily install the compiler, language libraries and other associated tools.
Haskell was first released in 1990 by Paul Hudak and Simon Peyton Jones at Yale University. It was designed with the
goal of providing a purely functional language that could be used for both research and practical purposes. The language
was initially called “Goedel2”, but was later renamed Haskell after the logician Haskell Curry.
Since its initial release, Haskell has gone through multiple iterations and releases, as well as numerous libraries. It
also has a thriving open source community that contributes to the development of the language.

The current version of Haskell is Haskell 2018. This version includes several features, such as separate compilation,
advanced pattern matching, and support for new language extensions. In addition, several other features such as
generalized algebraic data types, extensible records, and implicit parameters were added.

## Features

One of the major characteristics of Haskell is that it is a purely functional language. This means that all functions
are pure mathematical functions, meaning they have no side effects and always produce the same result when given the
same inputs.
Another feature of Haskell is its laziness. Haskell is a lazy language, meaning that it will only evaluate expressions
when they are needed. This lazy evaluation allows for more efficient memory management and enables developers to write
code that is more modular and maintainable.
Haskell also has a strong static type system. This means that the types of variables and functions are checked at
compilation time and any errors are caught early on in the development process. This makes it easier to refactor code
and prevents many bugs from being introduced into the program.
Lastly, Haskell has a robust suite of libraries available. These libraries provide a wide range of functionality
including graphics, web development, databases, data structures, and more.

Haskell has a number of features that make it unique and attractive to programmers. These features include:

* A Lazy Evaluation Model: In Haskell, computations are not evaluated until their result is needed. This makes the
  language particularly well suited for situations where some data may never be used. This also leads to faster program
  execution times and reduced memory usage.
* Purely Functional Design: Unlike other programming languages, Haskell is designed to be purely functional. This means
  that the code is free of side-effects and is composed of functions that take one input and return one output. As a
  result, programs written in the language are predictable and reliable.
* Rich Type System: Haskell has a rich type system. This enables programs to have strong guarantees about the types of
  data they are dealing with. This reduces the chances of errors occurring due to incompatible data types.
* Concurrent and Parallel Computing Support: Haskell makes it easy to write programs that can take advantage of multiple
  cores on a computer. The language features a range of abstractions and libraries that allow developers to easily write
  code that can run in parallel or concurrently.
* Compiler & Interpreter Support: Haskell comes with both a compiler and an interpreter. This allows programmers to
  prototype their ideas quickly using the interpreter, and then use the compiler to produce optimized code for deploying
  applications.

## Libraries

Haskell has a wide variety of libraries and tools available. Some popular libraries include:

* `base`: the standard library that comes with the compiler,
* `containers`: a library providing data structures,
* `parsec`: a library providing parsing combinators,
* `text`: a library for manipulating Unicode text,
* `vector`: a high-performance library for vectors,
* `lens`: a library for immutable data structures,
* `hmatrix`: a library providing matrix operations,
* `conduit`: a library for streaming data,
* `yesod`: a web framework.

## Examples

Below are some examples of basic Haskell programs:

### Hello World

Here’s an example of a simple Hello World program in Haskell:

```haskell
main = do
putStrLn "Hello World!"
```

This program prints out `Hello World!` to the console.

### Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion in programming, and can easily be implemented in Haskell. Here
is an example of a recursive Fibonacci function:

```haskell
fibonacci 0 = 0
fibonacci 1 = 1
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)
```

This function takes in a single argument, `n`, and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

### Factorial

Factorial is another classic example of recursive programming, and can be implemented as such in Haskell:

```haskell
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
```

This function takes in a single argument, `n`, and returns `n!`.

## Examples

Here is a simple example of a Haskell program:

```Haskell
main = do
    putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

This program prints the string “Hello, World!” to the console.

Here is a more complex example of a Haskell program:

```Haskell
import Data.List

main = do
    let xs = [1,2,3,4]
    print $ maximum $ permutations xs
```

This program finds and prints the maximum permutation of the list `xs`.

## Syntax

Haskell has a very concise and concise syntax. Here is an example of a simple program:

```Haskell
double x = x * 2

main = do
    print $ double 5
```

This program prints the value 10 to the console.

The following example shows how to create a simple web server in Haskell:

```
import Network.HTTP.Server
import Network.HTTP.Types

main = do
  let s = server { port = 8080 }
  -- set up the server
  serve s $ \rq ->
    -- handle requests
    return $
      -- return a response
      responseLBS status200 [] "Hello World!"
```

This code will set up a basic web server on port 8080. When a request is received, the code will send back a response
with the status code 200 (OK) and the message “Hello World!”.

Haskell is used in many areas, including data science, finance, web development, and game development. It's become
popular for computational tasks that require immense processing power, such as deep learning, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, image recognition, and more.
It's also been used to develop robust systems such as banking systems, network protocols, and large scale data analysis
systems. Additionally, Haskell has been used to develop distributed systems which can handle billions of requests per
second.

One popular example of a Haskell application is Cloud Haskell, which is a framework for building distributed systems.
Cloud Haskell makes it easy to build distributed applications on multiple nodes that can communicate with one another.
Other applications of Haskell include WebRTC, which provides real-time communication between browsers and applications;
Quid, an analytics platform for financial markets; and front-end web development frameworks such as Yesod and Happstack.

Here is a simple example of Haskell code that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with only the even numbers:

```haskell
-- filter_even takes a list of numbers and returns a list containing only the even numbers
filter_even :: [Int] -> [Int]
filter_even xs = [x | x <- xs, mod x 2 == 0]
```

## Use Cases

Examples of Use:

1. Web Development: Haskell is becoming increasingly popular in web development circles. Popular open source web
   frameworks like Yesod and Snap are written in Haskell, making it possible to quickly and easily build dynamic
   websites with less code.
2. Data Science: Haskell is a great language for working with large datasets. Libraries such as HMatrix and hmatrix-gsl
   enable developers to quickly perform operations on matrices and numerical data.
3. Machine Learning: Many libraries are available for performing machine learning tasks in Haskell. These include hnn,
   which provides algorithms for neural networks, and hlearn, which provides a range of tools for supervised and
   unsupervised machine learning.
4. Algorithmic Trading: Haskell is an ideal language for developing algorithmic trading systems. Libraries such as
   BookMap and Noft allow developers to quickly and easily develop complex financial trading strategies.
5. Computer Graphics: Haskell is well suited for developing applications that require high performance computer
   graphics. For example, the library Glome.hs can be used to create 3D graphics.
6. System Administration: Haskell is an excellent language for system administration tasks. Popular open source
   libraries such as Shelly and Turtle provide powerful tools for automating system processes.

## Conclusion

Haskell is a powerful and versatile programming language that has found widespread use in many different areas. Its
immutable data structures and lazy evaluation make it ideal for tasks that require immense processing power. It's also
been used to create robust systems such as banking systems and distributed applications.
