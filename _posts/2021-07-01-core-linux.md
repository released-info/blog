# INTRODUCTION OF THECNOLOGY
Tiny Core Linux is a minimalist operating system that uses as a base a simplified and modified Linux kernel, along with BusyBox and FLTK, to provide users with the essential tools to make a computer fully functional. Its main feature is undoubtedly its size, and its developers have managed to reduce it to 16 MB or 21 MB, depending on the version we choose. The idea they developed was to create an operating system with a graphical desktop that could be started from a CD or USB, as well as from a hard disk as much as possible.
