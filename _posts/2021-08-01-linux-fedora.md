# Linux Fedora
Fedora Server is a powerful and flexible operating system that incorporates the best and latest data center technologies. Gives you control over all services and infrastructure. Learn more. Fedora IoT provides a reliable open-source platform that serves as a solid foundation for the IoT ecosystem. To do this Linux is used, which is a much more stable system than Windows, this is mainly due to its level of customization that allows it to fit and work effectively on any computer. Due to its stability, Linux is widely used to manage servers on the Internet.
Fedora is distributed as an installation DVD or a set of 5 CDs. All the packages offered are selected to provide a wide range of use, from home to professional, without neglecting system administrators and software developers.

# Release cycle
The Fedora Project releases a new version of Fedora Linux approximately every six months and provides updated (maintenance) packages for those versions for approximately 13 months. Version N-2 ends 4 weeks after the release of version N of Fedora Linux.

# Versions
* Fedora Core 1 - Yarrow Released on November 6, 2003, "Yarrow" was the first version of Fedora Core. It was built on the 2.4.19 kernel and was the latest version of Red Hat with a 2.4 kernel.
* Fedora Core 2 - Tettnang Released on May 18, 2004, "Tettnang" was released. It was the first GNU/Linux distribution to include a 2.6 branch kernel. Fedora Core 2 is prone to a number of problems: firstly, it is difficult to install proprietary drivers, such as those of Nvidia, since the 4KSTACK option
* Fedora Core 3 - Heidelberg The release of "Heidelberg" on 8 November 2004 confirmed the popularity of distribution among users. It runs in kernel 2.6.9 and GNOME 2.8, and also features Firefox, allowing a name transition from Mozilla. This release marks the first step backwards for the Bluecurve visual environment, which is a composite between two major desktops: GNOME and KDE. Fedora Core 3 is the basis for RHEL 4.
* Fedora Core 4 - Stentz Released on June 13, 2005 "Stentz" was the first distribution compiled with a new version of GCC, which significantly improved its performance. The disadvantage of this update is that all packages must be rebuilt. Trust in the "Extras" repository is clearly demonstrated.
* Fedora Core 5 - Bordeaux The March 20, 2006 release, "Bordeaux", was the first release to feature mono and mono-based features, such as Beagle, F-Spot and Tomboy. The recent protection of Mono technology by ISO boosted this inclusion. In addition to these new features, we also noticed the availability of a graphical interface for the Yum package manager.

* Fedora 8 -  "Werewolf" Published on November 8, 2007. During the distribution development cycle, an updated version of Fedora 7 was considered. However, the new features it offers remain important: in fact, it is the first version of Fedora to offer a different ISO image.
