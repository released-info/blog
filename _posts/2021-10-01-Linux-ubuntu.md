# Next versions

Ubuntu 22.10 Beta is the next release in which we will find surprising news, although not a significant release due to
its "intermediate" character and limited support for only nine months. The most notable novelty of Ubuntu 22.10 is
PipeWire as a default audio server instead of Pulse Audio, so Ubuntu users will no longer have to do anything to use the
new standard for media routing and channel management, o Linux.
