        Red Hat initially triumphed by seconding a custom Linux distribution, then called "Red Hat" The increase and reliability of Red Hat Linux made both synonymous in the minds of many people. From those early days, Red Hat’s resolutions and technologies have been based on this triumph to integrate almost every point of the IT stack.

Red Hat curates, guarantees and supports a distribution of Linux, now popular as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, a change that
happened in 2003 as a result of the merger with the Fedora Linux Plan. Today, Red Hat Enterprise Linux supports and
powers program and technologies for automation, cloud, container, middleware, storage, application development,
microservices, virtualization, management and more. Linux plays a pivotal role as the core of many of Red Hat’s
offerings. It goes much further than simply being a server operating system: Linux is the foundation of the updated IT
stack.

# Release cycle of Linux Red Hat

The RedHat enterprise Linux life cycle has been changing through the time, that is why it is vital to know what the
changes and the life cycle of Linux have been.

Red hat enterprise linux version 7 offers full support up to 5.5 years, maintenance support up to 1 year, but Red Hat
does not support extensive upgrade or extended lifetime support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.

Red hat does understand the importance of the life cycle for the correct use and satisfaction of customers, partners and
for the Linux ecosystem in general, therefore RedHat version 8 and 9 enterprise linux offers a life cycle with full
support, together with an extended life cycle maintenance, being a full support the first 5 years, a maintenance support
the next 5 years later and then an extended life phase two years after the first 10
