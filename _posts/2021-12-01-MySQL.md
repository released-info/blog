        MySQL is the most widely used relational database management system today because it is based on open source. Originally developed by MySQL AB, it was acquired by Sun MicroSystems in 2008 and in 2010 by Oracle Corporation, which already had its own MySQL InnoDB engine.

MySQL is a dual-licensed database management system. On the one hand, it is open source, but on the other hand, it has a
commercial version managed by Oracle Corporation. Enterprise Edition is designed for companies who want to integrate it
into a patented product, including additional products or services such as monitoring and support tools.
MySQL has opted for an approach called relational databases. With a relational database, your data is divided into
separate storage areas (called tables) instead of placing them all in a large storage unit. For example, suppose you
want to store two types of information: Customers: their names, addresses, details, etc. Orders, such as the product
they bought, the price, who placed the order, etc. If you try to put all this data in a large jar, you will encounter
some problems such as:
Different data: The data you need to collect for orders is different from the data you collect for customers. Duplicate
data: each customer has a name and each order has a customer name. Dealing with duplicate data is often complicated. No
organization: how to succinctly link order information with customer information?
To solve these problems, a relational database would use a separate table for clients and a separate table for orders.

# Release cycle of MySQL

MySQL is always looking to redesign its format, and to give its public, always the best This official technology (GA) is
updated every 18 to 24 months. Versions of GA can be found in MySQL Developer Zone. GA releases occur as follows:
-A GA version is based on a DMR. The selected DMR undergoes additional testing and error correction; then a first RC (
release candidate) is produced and made public.
-The Release Candidate goes through the evaluation of customers and users; this may cause the need for more RC cycles
until GA quality is reached.
-The release of GA is published and announced.

# Next versions

Oracle introduces My SQL Autopilot software, which allows the use of artificial intelligence to optimize and automate
MySQL HeatWave services. "Autopilot uses machine learning to run its database. Now, it’s about using it with your data".
Oracle launched an industry first study on machine learning benchmarks using a large number of public data sets from
different providers, some analysts said.
In smaller clusters, machine learning models trained with MySQL HeatWave were on average 25 times faster and cost only
1% of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift ML. Benchmarks based on public machine learning datasets show that MySQL
HeatWave outperforms Google’s BigQuery, Microsoft’s Azure Synapse and Snowflake solutions, and even AWS’s Redshift with
query accelerators.

based on public machine learning datasets show that MySQL heatwave offers better value than BigQuery solutions from
Google, Microsoft Azure Synapse and Snowflake, and even AWS Redshift with its query accelerator.
