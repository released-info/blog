        Go is a relatively new programming language, its official release was in late 2009 (although its first stable release was in 2012), so it is not even ten years old. It was developed by Google, specifically by Ken Thompson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer; Pike said Golang’s main goal is to eliminate slowness and improve Google’s development process, making it productive and scalable.

Golang is supposed to be a language developed by people who write, read, constantly debug and maintain great systems.
Golang is distributed under a BSD-style license and much of the language development is entirely open source, meaning
the community is free to contribute to its improvements.
Go is already on par with scripting languages like Python in its ability to meet many common programming needs. Some of
these functions are built into the language itself, such as "goroutines" for concurrence and thread-like behavior, while
others are provided in standard Go library packages, such as the Go http package.
The GO language supports communication channels based on the CSP language. However, simultaneity in Go differs from
block-based programming standards such as pthreads. Additionally, the creators of Go were inspired by the versatility
and qualities of other languages such as Python, C++ and Java (among others) to implement a language with the following
characteristics, some unique and some incompatible with other compiled languages Shared.Go has a garbage collector like
most modern languages. Go’s garbage collector is being reimplemented to reduce latency as much as possible.

# Release cycle of Go language

The current launch cycle begins on February 1 and August 1 each year. Traditionally, beta versions, release candidates
and releases are usually cut and broadcast during the week (usually on Wednesdays).
Launch a secondary version to solve a problem or a more critical problem without an alternative solution (usually
related to stability or safety). The only code changes included in this release are fixes for specific critical issues.
It is also possible to include only important changes in documentation and security test updates (such as disabling
testing).

# Next versions

Google has announced the release of a new update for its mobile operating system called Android 13 (Go edition), and
unlike the future Android 13 (which has not yet been officially released), it has an interface developed and designed
for phones. This, so far, has been the latest novelty that Google has brought to the community and improving its
interface.

Google indicates that smartphones compatible with Android 13 (Go edition) have a very limited storage capacity that
cannot be compromised, so they have developed system updates. This is a way for devices to receive regular updates
without compromising their storage. "The result is a phone that stays up to date over time, and you don’t have to wait
for the next version or a software update from your phone manufacturer to get the latest and the best," says Google
