        Rust is a compiled, general purpose, multiparadigm programming language being developed by Rust Foundation. It is a multiparadigmatic programming language that supports pure, method, imperative and object-oriented programming.

Also Rust leads performance, reliability and productivity, Rust is lightning fast and memory efficient: without runtime
or garbage collection, it can support critical performance services, run on embedded devices, and integrate with other
languages easily.
Rust’s rich type system and proprietary model (ownership) support memory stability and thread stability, and allow you
to clear many kinds of bugs at compile time.
And talking about productivity, Rust have grate documentation, an accessible compilator with useful error messages, and
top-notch tools: package manager and plan included, advanced multi-editor support with autocomplete and type
inspections, auto-formatter, etc.

# Release cycle of Rust language

Rust launches every 6 weeks, like clockwork. If you know the date of a Rust release, you can know the date of the next
one: it’s 6 weeks later. An optimal aspect of having scheduled launches every 6 weeks is that the next railroad will
arrive fast.
