# Introduction to Redis Release Cycle

Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It stores data in
a key-value format and offers high performance, low latency, and high availability. Redis is written in C and is used by
many companies to build web, mobile, gaming, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications. The library is highly scalable
and supports a wide range of data types, from simple strings to hashes, lists, sets, bitmaps, and more.
Redis is primarily used for caching, but can also be used as a database and message broker. It is extremely fast, due to
its in-memory data structure, and it can handle large volumes of data without any performance degradation. Redis is also
easy to scale up or down, using a master-slave architecture, and provides built-in replication and high availability.

## History of Redis

Redis was created by Salvatore Sanfilippo in 2009. It was initially released as an open-source project and has since
become one of the most popular databases in the world. Redis is now maintained by Redis Labs, which oversees the
development and maintenance of the software.
The first version of Redis was released in April 2009. Since then, there have been hundreds of releases, with major new
features and improvements added. There have been several major versions of Redis over the years, including Redis 2.8,
3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0.

## Redis Release Cycle

Redis is released on a regular basis, usually every 4-6 weeks. Each release includes new features, bug fixes, and
performance improvements. The Redis release cycle is managed by Redis Labs, which is responsible for maintaining the
software and releasing new versions.
The cycle starts with the release of a new version. This version is then tested and any issues reported by users are
fixed. Once all issues have been addressed, a stable version is released. This version is then maintained for around six
weeks, with bug fixes and minor improvements released.
At the end of the six-week period, a new version is released and the cycle starts again. This cycle ensures that the
software is stable and reliable, while also allowing for new features and improvements to be added on a regular basis.

## Versions of Redis

There have been several major versions of Redis released since it was first released. These versions include Redis 2.8,
3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0. Below is a brief overview of each version.

* **Redis 2.8:** Released in April 2013, this version added sharding, replication, and improved performance.
* **Redis 3.0:** Released in April 2015, this version included new commands, better memory management, and a new data
  type, streams.
* **Redis 4.0:** Released in October 2016, this version added support for transactions, improved performance, and
  introduced the Cluster API.
* **Redis 5.0:** Released in October 2017, this version added support for the RediSearch module, ReJSON, and improved
  performance.
* **Redis 6.0:** Released in April 2020, this version added support for ACID transactions, improved memory management,
  enhanced security, and streams enhancements.

## How to Upgrade Redis

Redis can be upgraded at any time by downloading the latest version from the Redis website and replacing the existing
version. It is recommended that users upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible to ensure they have access to
the latest features and bug fixes.

## Conclusion
