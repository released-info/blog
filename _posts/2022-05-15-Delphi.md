# Delphi

Delphi is a programming language used to rapidly develop software applications on various platforms, including Windows
and macOS. It is an object-oriented language and was originally released in 1995 by Borland as part of the Borland C++
product. It is now owned by Embarcadero Technologies.

Delphi is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed and marketed by Embarcadero Technologies. It is
based on the Pascal language and is an alternative to Microsoft's Visual Basic. Delphi was originally created by Borland
in 1995 and was later acquired by Embarcadero in 2008. The language enables developers to rapidly develop Windows and
macOS applications with graphical user interfaces (GUI) and database access. Delphi is a popular choice for RAD (Rapid
Application Development) programming due to its fast and powerful development environment.

## History of Delphi

Delphi was originally released in 1995 as an Pascal-based object-oriented language. Borland’s team of engineers, led by
Anders Hejlsberg, designed the language to be a simple development environment for Windows applications. Over the years,
Borland released several versions of Delphi that included new features, such as database access, enhanced GUI tools and
multithreading support.
In 2008, the rights to Delphi were acquired by Embarcadero Technologies. Embarcadero has since released numerous
versions of Delphi that contain new features, such as improved IDE, better debugging tools and support for mobile
devices. Delphi is still actively developed and supported by Embarcadero and is a popular choice for Windows and macOS
development.
Delphi was initially developed as a Pascal-based language customized for the needs of the Rapid Application
Development (RAD) environment built into the Borland IDE. It was designed to be a "first-class" Windows development
tool, incorporating graphical user interface (GUI) components and the ability to access existing Windows libraries.
In 1997, Borland released Delphi 4, which included the first true object-oriented features, transforming Delphi from a
procedural language to an object-oriented one. Delphi 5, released in 1999, further improved the object-oriented features
of Delphi, and added support for web development using ActiveX and COM components.

Delphi is a programming language based on the Pascal programming language. It was developed by Borland in 1995 and is
often used by programmers to create Windows-based applications. The language is object-oriented and has support for
classes, objects, and structures. It has built-in support for database access and multimedia elements, as well as a
range of tools and libraries that aid in the development process.

## Origins

Delphi was created by the Borland Corporation in 1995 as an alternative to C++. Originally called Object Pascal, the
language was designed to be easy to learn and use for both novice and experienced developers. The syntax is similar to
Pascal and is designed to be compatible with the Pascal compiler.

The language was originally intended to be used to develop database applications, but since its creation it has been
used for developing a wide range of applications, such as: medical and financial software, videogames, web browsers, and
other types of applications.

# Overview of Delphi

Delphi is a programming language and software development environment used by developers to create a wide range of
applications. It is an object-oriented language that lies on the border between compiled and interpreted languages,
providing rapid application development with a very fast compiler and native compilation for the Windows platform. Many
language elements are shared with Pascal, C and C++, making it easier for those familiar with these languages to learn
Delphi.

Delphi was initially released in 1995 as part of Borland's suite of RAD tools. It was one of the first development
environments to encompass a complete visual interface for Form design, menu and toolbar design, and data access.

With its core strengths in Windows development (database, graphics, and networking technologies), Delphi has been widely
used to create business applications. It is also popular among students, hobbyists and professional programmers alike.

## Features

Delphi has many features that make it a suitable language for rapid application development. It has a clean syntax that
is easy to learn, and its Object Pascal language is based on Pascal and is fully compatible with the Pascal compiler. It
also has powerful debugging tools and refactoring capabilities.

In addition, Delphi has integrated database support and uses an open source database engine called Firebird. This allows
developers to quickly build database-driven applications. Additionally, Delphi has a modern user interface library with
support for various components, including buttons, menus, and grids.

Delphi also supports the development of distributed applications using the Remote Data Objects (RDO) protocol. RDO is a
protocol layer between databases and remote clients, allowing clients to access data from any database without having to
write their own code or know SQL statements.

Delphi provides a variety of features meant to simplify application development.

### Visual Component Library

The Visual Component Library (VCL) contains many components and objects that can be quickly and easily added to a
project. These components provide drag-and-drop functionality that speeds up development and decreases potential errors.

### Database Support

Delphi includes a library of database-aware components that allow developers to quickly create database applications.
This includes support for popular databases like Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, InterBase, and Firebird.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Delphi is an object-oriented programming language that supports inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and other
principles of OOP. This makes it easier for inexperienced developers to start creating applications, and for experienced
ones to get the most out of the language.

### Fast Compiler

The Delphi compiler is extremely fast, allowing for quick feedback and iteration during development. This helps
significantly reduce time to market for applications.

### Native Compilation

With Delphi, developers can compile their code into native executables for many platforms, including Windows and macOS.
This allows developers to create applications that run quickly and efficiently on the target platform.

### IDE

Delphi includes a fully-featured integrated development environment that simplifies the entire development process. The
IDE comes with a code editor, debugger, and integrated help system, making development faster and easier.

## Examples of Delphi Usage

Delphi has been used to create a variety of applications, ranging from simple games to sophisticated business systems.

### Games

Delphi has been used to create some of the most popular PC games of all time. One example is Age of Empires III, a
real-time strategy game created by Ensemble Studios. The game was released in 2005 and became an instant classic,
winning numerous awards and selling millions of copies worldwide.

### Business Applications

Delphi is also popular for creating business applications. Many companies have used the language to develop custom
software for their businesses, ranging from invoicing systems to complex ERP solutions. For example, Korean company
Korea Construction Company uses Delphi to develop their own business software.

### Web Applications

Delphi can also be used to create web applications. Developers can use the language to create powerful web applications
that run on Windows servers. One example is the popular content management system Sitecore, which was built using
Delphi.

## Code Example

The following code demonstrates a basic "Hello World" program written in Delphi:

```
program HelloWorld;

begin
  Writeln('Hello World!');
end.
```

When compiled and run, this code will output the message "Hello World!" to the console.

Delphi is widely used in the development of business and financial software. Many major companies have adopted Delphi
for developing their accounting systems, billing systems, and other related applications. It is also used in the
development of medical software, such as electronic medical records, imaging systems, and patient tracking applications.

Due to its powerful debugging and refactoring capabilities, Delphi is increasingly being used in the development of game
engines and video games. It is also popular among web developers, who use it to create dynamic websites and web
applications.

Below is an example of a simple Delphi program that prints “Hello, World!” to the console window.

```
program HelloWorld; 
begin
  WriteLn('Hello, World!');
end.
```

The following example shows how to create a class in Delphi and use it in a program.

```
type 
  TPerson = class 
    name : string; 
    age : Integer; 
  end; 
  
var 
  person : TPerson;
  
begin 
  person := TPerson.Create;
  person.name := 'John Smith'; 
  person.age := 42; 
  WriteLn('Name: ', person.name);
  WriteLn('Age: ', person.age);
end.
``` 

The following example shows how to connect to a Firebird database in Delphi.

```
uses 
  DBXFirebird, DB;
  
var 
  Conn : TDBXConnection; 

begin
  Conn := TDBXConnectionFactory.GetConnectionFactory.GetConnection;
  try 
    Conn.Open;
  finally 
    Conn.Free; 
  end; 
end; 
```

The following is a simple code example of a Delphi program that prints "Hello World" to the console window:

```
program HelloWorld;
 
begin
  writeln('Hello World!');
end.
```

This example shows how easy it is to write a simple Delphi program. The `program` keyword starts the program,
the `begin` keyword indicates the start of the main code block and the `end` keyword indicates the end of the code
block. In between, the `writeln` command is used to print the string "Hello World".

### Building Desktop Applications

One of the most common uses of Delphi is to build desktop applications. These typically involve the creation of GUI
windows and forms, and the use of components such as buttons, list boxes, table grids, etc.

A simple example of this is a contact list application. The user might enter their contacts' details into the
application, and then view or edit them at any time. The program could have a main window with a list of contacts, and
individual windows for entering and editing contact details.

The following simple Delphi code snippet creates a form with a button that shows a message when clicked:

```pascal
// Creates a form
var Form1 : TForm; 
 
// Creates a button
var Button1 : TButton; 
 
// Initializes the form and button
procedure InitializeForm; 
begin 
  // Create an instance of the form
  Form1 := TForm.Create(nil); 
 
  // Set the caption for the form
  Form1.Caption := 'My Form'; 
 
  // Create an instance of the button
  Button1 := TButton.Create(Form1); 
 
  // Set the caption for the button
  Button1.Caption := 'Click Me!'; 
 
  // Set the size and position of the button
  Button1.Left := 10; 
  Button1.Top := 10; 
  Button1.Width := 100; 
  Button1.Height := 25; 
 
  // Register the OnClick event for the button
  Button1.OnClick := @Button1Click; 
 
  // Add the button to the form
  Form1.InsertControl(Button1); 
end; 
 
// Button click event handler
procedure Button1Click(Sender : TObject); 
begin 
  ShowMessage('Hello World!'); 
end; 
 
begin 
  InitializeForm; 
  Form1.ShowModal; 
end; 
```

### Creating Web Applications

Delphi can be used to create web applications that run on web servers, such as Apache or IIS. Delphi applications can
also run on ASP.NET or Apache/Tomcat-based servers.

The following example code creates a web service using Delphi:

```pascal
uses 
  Data.DBXJSON, 
  Datasnap.DSProviderDataModuleAdapter, 
  Datasnap.DSAuth, 
  Web.WebReq; 
 
type 
  TService = class(TObject) 
  private 
    { Private declarations } 
  public 
    function EchoString(Value: string): string; 
  end; 
 
function TService.EchoString(Value: string): string; 
begin 
  Result := Value; 
end; 
 
var 
  WebModuleClass: TComponentClass = TService; 
 
exports 
  ServiceGetModule, 
  DSHTTPWebDispatcherInvoker; 
initialization 
  WebRequestHandler.WebModuleClass := WebModuleClass; 
```
