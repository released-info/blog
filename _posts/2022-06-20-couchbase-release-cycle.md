# Apache Couchbase Release Cycle

The Apache Couchbase project has three main releases: an Enterprise Edition (EE) release, a Community Edition (CE) release, and an open source release. The EE release is the most complete package which provides the most robust features and stability. The CE release is the next most feature-rich package and has the least amount of stability. The open source release is the smallest of the packages and only includes the core components of Couchbase Server.

The Enterprise Edition release of Apache Couchbase is typically released every six months. This release contains the latest additions and enhancements to the Couchbase Server, including security fixes and bug fixes. This version also contains the most up-to-date API's and is recommended for production-level deployments.

The Community Edition release of Apache Couchbase is typically released on a quarterly basis. This release contains the same features as the EE release, but is more targeted towards the developer community. This release is ideal for developers who are looking for an introduction to the Couchbase Server, or for those who want to work with the new features prior to their inclusion into the EE release.

The open source release of Apache Couchbase is the smallest of the packages and only includes the core components of Couchbase Server. This is the best release for developers who are starting out with Couchbase Server. This release does not contain any additional features, but it does allow developers to do basic tasks such as setup their environment, build applications, and run basic queries.

When using Apache Couchbase, it is important to ensure that your applications are running the most up-to-date version. With the EE and CE releases, this is done through regular updates. For the open source release, the best practice is to download the latest version of the source code and compile it yourself.

Code Examples:

To connect to Couchbase Server using the Java SDK, you must first obtain an instance of the CouchbaseEnvironment object. The CouchbaseEnvironment provides access to all of the available settings and capabilities of the Couchbase Server.

```java
CouchbaseEnvironment env = DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment.builder()
                .connectTimeout(10_000) // 10 seconds
                .socketConnectTimeout(30_000) // 30 seconds
                .build();
```

Once you have an instance of the CouchbaseEnvironment, you can use it to create a CouchbaseCluster instance. This will give you an interface for connecting to the Couchbase Server.

```java
CouchbaseCluster cluster = CouchbaseCluster.create(env, "localhost");
```

Once you have the cluster instance, you can open a connection to the server by opening a Bucket. The following example uses the default bucket, which is not recommended for production deployments.

```java
Bucket bucket = cluster.openBucket("default");
```

You can then use the Bucket instance to perform various operations on the server, such as retrieving documents or creating/updating documents. For example:

```java
JsonObject myDocument = JsonObject.create()
                .put("name", "John Doe")
                .put("age", 42);

bucket.upsert(JsonDocument.create("user:1", myDocument));

JsonDocument retrievedDoc = bucket.get("user:1");
System.out.println("Retrieved document:" + retrievedDoc.content());
```

Finally, you must be sure to close the connection when you are done using the server.

```java
bucket.close();
```

With the release cycle of Apache Couchbase, you can always make sure that your applications are running the most up-to-date version. The Enterprise Edition and Community Edition releases provide the most up-to-date features, while the open source release gives developers an introduction to Couchbase Server.
