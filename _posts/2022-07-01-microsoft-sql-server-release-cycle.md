# Microsoft SQL Server Release Cycle

## What is the Microsoft SQL Server Release Cycle?
The Microsoft SQL Server Release Cycle is the sequence and timeline of events that Microsoft follows when deploying updates, new features, and fixes for the MS SQL Server software. This release cycle outlines the phases of each release, the expected delivery times, any special considerations to take into account before pushing the updates out, and other considerations.

The release cycle typically includes three stages, from start to finish:

* **Planning**: During this phase, Microsoft first meets with customers to discuss their needs and plans for an upcoming release. The company then works on outlining a plan for what features, fixes, and changes will be included in the version update.

* **Development**: Once the plan has been established, coding and testing of those features or changes is done. This is done to make sure everything works properly, is stable, and able to integrate smoothly with any existing systems.

* **Release**: At the end of this phase, the new version is released to customers. This can be done through various channels, including an online portal, CD/DVD media, or some other method.

## History
Microsoft SQL Server was first released in 1989. Since then, the software has been regularly updated and improved upon. Microsoft usually follows a regular release schedule, issuing new versions every two to three years. Early expressions of SQL Server were fairly basic, but they have grown exponentially in complexity ever since.

In 2005, Microsoft changed the way it handled its release cycle. Instead of following a predictable schedule, the company began releasing new versions on an as-needed basis. This helped them to quickly address customer issues as they arose, rather than waiting for set release dates.

## Usages
Microsoft SQL Server is used by businesses of all sizes across the world. It is often found in applications such as data warehousing, e-commerce, and web services. The software is also used in many types of industries, including finance, healthcare, and education.

The software has various advantages over other relational database management systems, such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Some of these advantages include scalability, reliability, and compatibility with other technologies. It is well-known for its security features, making it a popular choice for mission-critical applications.

## Code Examples
Below are some examples of code snippets from Microsoft SQL Server:

**Creating a Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE [Employee]
(
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    JobTitle VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Salary INT NOT NULL
);
```
**Inserting Data into a Table**
```sql
INSERT INTO [Employee] (EmpID, Name, JobTitle, Salary)
VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 'Manager', 60000);
```

**Updating a Record**
```sql
UPDATE [Employee]
SET Salary = 70000
WHERE EmpID = 1;
```

**Deleting a Record**
```sql
DELETE FROM [Employee]
WHERE EmpID = 1;
```

## Conclusion
The Microsoft SQL Server Release Cycle is an important part of the development process. It outlines the various stages and timelines of every release, helping to keep things organized and on track. Understanding the whole process can help businesses stay up-to-date with the latest versions of the software and ensure that their applications are running smoothly and securely.
