# Introduction to Android OS Release Cycle

## History of Android OS

The first commercial Android OS was released in September 2008, and formed a new era of mobile computing. Since then, it
has become the world’s most popular mobile operating system, with over two billion active users worldwide. The Android
OS is based on a Linux kernel and is open source, which has enabled developers to create a custom ROM (Read-Only Memory)
and/or modify operating system elements to meet different user needs.

Android OS receives regular updates that mainly serve to improve security, add new features and make existing features
more robust. With each version of Android, more devices become capable of running the new software.

## Android OS Versions

A wide range of OS versions have been released since 2008, such as Cupcake (1.5), Donut (1.6), Eclair (2.0/2.1), Froyo (
2.2), Gingerbread (2.3/2.3.3/2.3.7), Honeycomb (3.0/3.1/3.2), Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0/4.0.4), Jellybean (4.1/4.2/4.3),
KitKat (4.4), Lollipop (5.0/5.1), Marshmallow (6.0), Nougat (7.0/7.1), Oreo (8.0/8.1) and Pie (9.0).

## Android OS Release Schedule

Google usually releases a new version of Android OS every year, with each new version receiving a confectionery-inspired
name (such as Cupcake, Marshmallow, Oreo, etc.). Google also maintains a timeline with the expected release dates for
upcoming versions of Android, so that users can anticipate when new versions will be available.

Occasionally, Google will also announce a “major” update to the operating system, such as the Android 10 update, which
introduced a range of new features and improvements.

## Updating Your Device

In order to keep your device up to date with the latest Android OS version, simply go to your device’s Settings menu,
then select System Update. There, you can check whether your device is running the most recent version of Android. If it
isn’t, you will be prompted to download and install the update.

## Conclusion

Android OS release cycles involve the regular releases of new versions of the operating system, which are typically
accompanied by a range of new features and improvements. Understanding the history of Android OS, being familiar with
the major Android OS versions and updating your device to the latest version are all important steps towards having a
secure and reliable device.
