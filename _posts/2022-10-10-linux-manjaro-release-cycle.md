# Introduction to the Linux Manjaro Release Cycle

## History and Overview of Manjaro
Launched in 2011, Manjaro is a distribution (distro) of Linux created and maintained by the Manjaro Team, a non-profit organization. Manjaro is based on another popular distro, Arch Linux, and it combines the speed and simplicity of Arch with the accessibility and user-friendliness of Ubuntu. The main goal of Manjaro is to make advanced and modern Linux computing accessible to everyone. The team behind Manjaro continuously works to improve the distro and provide users with a reliable and secure operating system.

Manjaro follows a regular schedule of releases, with new versions rolling out every three months. For each release, the Manjaro Team creates a “Release Plan” outlining the key goals, objectives, and overall workflow. The team makes sure the release is tested and ready for distribution, then announced to the Manjaro community. Depending on the nature of the update, either a “Stable” or “Rolling” release is distributed.

## Types of Releases
Stable releases are static updates delivered to users every three months. These releases contain bug fixes, minor improvements, and any major changes that have been implemented since the previous Stable release. Stable releases can be seen as the finished product, and are recommended for users who prefer stability over experimental features.

Rolling releases are continuous software updates that arrive on a regular basis. Instead of waiting for the next Stable release, Rolling release users receive updates more frequently, usually every few weeks. This allows users to benefit from the latest updates and features as soon as they are available. Rolling releases are best suited for more experienced users, as they can be more prone to bugs and other issues.

## Process of a Manjaro Release
The Manjaro release cycle begins with a “Release Plan” outlining the main goals and objectives of the upcoming update. This plan is then shared with the Manjaro community to give everyone an idea of what will be included in the next release. Once the plan is finalized, the Manjaro Team begins working on implementing the planned changes.

Once the changes have been implemented, the team tests them extensively to make sure everything works as intended. Once the team is satisfied that the changes are stable, the release is announced to the community and made available for download. Depending on the type of release, users can then either upgrade to the new version or start using the newest version right away.

## Tips for Users
Before upgrading to a new Manjaro version, it’s important to make sure your current version is up to date. This ensures that you’ll get the most out of the new version and that there won’t be any compatibility issues. It’s also wise to make a backup of any important files or data before upgrading, just in case something goes wrong.

It’s also recommended to read the Release notes carefully before upgrading, so you know what to expect from the new version. The Manjaro community is a great source of information and support, so if you have any questions or concerns about a new release, don’t hesitate to reach out for help.

## Conclusion
Manjaro is known for its user-friendly interface and reliable releases, and understanding the Manjaro release cycle is an important part of getting the most out of the operating system.
