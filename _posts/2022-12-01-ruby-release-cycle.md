       Ruby is a powerful, object-oriented scripting language used for programming and scripting on the web. It has become popular due to its flexibility, simplicity and intuitive syntax. Developed in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto, it has grown to become one of the most popular languages for developing web applications, mobile applications, and system scripts.

# Introduction to the Ruby Release Cycle

The Ruby Release Cycle offers developers a chance to stay up-to-date with the latest updates and changes to the
language. In this article, we will take a look at what the Ruby Release Cycle is, its history, and how you can use it to
keep your code up-to-date.

## What is the Ruby Release Cycle?

The Ruby Release Cycle (RRC) is a set of guidelines used to determine when new versions of the Ruby programming language
will be released. This cycle ensures that developers can use the latest features and bug fixes in the language by
scheduling application updates.

The cycle consists of four phases:

1. Pre-release – This phase includes all of the development and testing of new features for the upcoming release.
2. Alpha – This is the first public release of the new version. It is intended for testing new features and finding
   bugs.
3. Beta – This is the second public release of the new version. This is the last chance to find and fix any bugs before
   full release.
4. Production – The final version of the language is released to the public. It is considered to be stable and ready to
   use in production.

Releases typically occur every six months, although they can be delayed or skipped if major bugs are discovered during
the testing phases.

## History of the Ruby Release Cycle

The initial version of the Ruby programming language was released in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto. The language had a
simple syntax and was designed to be easy to learn and use. Over time, the language evolved, with many new features and
bug fixes being added.

In 2006, the Ruby Release Cycle was created in order to maintain an up-to-date version of the language. This allowed
developers to stay updated and use the latest features without having to wait for the next major release. The cycle also
helped improve the stability and security of the language, as each release went through rigorous testing before being
released to the public.

## Examples of Usages

The Ruby Release Cycle offers developers several benefits. It allows them to stay up-to-date with the latest features
and bug fixes, while also making sure their apps are running smoothly and securely. Here are some examples of how
developers can use the Ruby Release Cycle:

* Keeping track of the software's version and ensuring it is up-to-date.
* Writing unit tests that check for compatibility with the latest version of Ruby.
* Automating deployments of the latest version of the language.
* Automatically running static analysis on the codebase to ensure it complies with the newest version of the language.

## Code Examples

To help illustrate how the Ruby Release Cycle works, here are some code examples using the rbenv utility. rbenv is a
tool that allows you to easily switch between multiple versions of Ruby and manage the versions installed on your
system.

### Installing a Version of Ruby

To install a specific version of Ruby, use the `rbenv install` command:

```
rbenv install 2.7.1
```

This will install the specified version of Ruby on your system.

### Setting the Default Version of Ruby

To set the default version of Ruby to use, use the `rbenv global` command:

```
rbenv global 2.7.1
```

This will set the specified version of Ruby as the default version used by your system.

### Using a Specific Version of Ruby

To temporarily use a specific version of Ruby for a project, use the `rbenv local` command:

```
rbenv local 2.7.1
```

This will force the specified version of Ruby to be used for the current project.

## Conclusion

The Ruby Release Cycle is an important part of keeping the language up-to-date. It allows developers to take advantage
of the latest features and bug fixes while also maintaining stability and security in their applications. By following
the Ruby Release Cycle, developers can ensure their code is always up-to-date and secure.
