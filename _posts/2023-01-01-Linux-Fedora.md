# What is Linux Fedora?

Linux Fedora is a Linux-based operating system developed by the Fedora Project as a free, open source alternative to
other popular operating systems. The Fedora Project is an open source community-driven project sponsored by Red Hat, a
leading Linux and open source software provider since 1993.

Fedora is developed by a large and ever-growing community of contributors, with numerous opportunities for users to get
involved. It provides extensive support for a huge range of hardware, applications and user configurations, including
server, desktop and laptop systems. It also offers up-to-date packages from its large repository that provide users with
the means to install and use nearly any application they want.

Linux Fedora is a popular open source operating system (OS) developed and maintained by the Fedora Project. It is based
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It's used by computer users around the world to power their desktops, laptops, and
servers. Fedora provides a stable, reliable, and secure platform for software development, web development, and system
administration.

## History of Linux Fedora

The first version of Fedora was released on November 6th, 2003, as a combination of two existing projects, Fedora Core
and Red Hat Linux. It was intended to be a short-term project that would develop and maintain a targeted set of core
packages for the growing Red Hat Linux user base.

Over time, the project has evolved beyond its initial ambitions, becoming a full-featured operating system with support
for a wide variety of applications and hardware. Now, Fedora serves as a platform for the development of new
technologies, such as Wayland and Systemd, as well as a platform for innovation in software packages, like GNOME, KDE,
XFCE, and more.

In 2011, Fedora became the basis for the OLPC initiative, providing a secure and reliable operating system to power
low-cost laptops for developing countries. Thanks to this initiative, Fedora has played an important role in making
technology more accessible worldwide.

The Fedora Project was launched in 2003 as a joint venture between Red Hat and the open source development community.
The goal of the project was to create a Linux-based operating system that was stable, reliable, and easy to use. The
first version of Fedora was released in November of that same year, and since then it has grown in popularity and become
one of the most widely-used Linux distributions.

The Fedora project has been maintained by Red Hat since its inception and the company has contributed heavily to its
development and upkeep over the years. However, the project is also backed by a large community of users and
contributors, who help to keep the project going and provide valuable feedback and new features.

The success of the project led to the creation of a series of releases, each based on a different version of the Linux
kernel. This allowed developers to take advantage of newer technologies while still maintaining compatibility with older
systems. Each version of Fedora also included a selection of programs and libraries designed to make it easier for users
to get up and running quickly.

One of the distinguishing features of Fedora is its focus on providing the latest technology. With each new release, the
project provides new tools, applications, and packages for users. This makes Fedora an ideal choice for those looking to
experiment with the latest technologies or to develop their own applications.
