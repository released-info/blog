The database supports a wide range of programming languages, including Java, C++, PHP, and SQL, as well as transaction
processing and query optimization. It is also highly secure and can be used on multiple operating systems, including
Linux and Windows.

Oracle Database was first released in 1977 by Oracle Corporation. Its initial version was based on the Sybase SQL Server
but was later rewritten from the ground up. Since then it has gone through several major releases and minor updates.
Oracle Database is now in its 19th major release.

In 1979, Oracle released the second generation of its database, Oracle Version 2. This version featured distributed
transactions, partitioning, recovery, and other features that made it popular with large enterprises. In 1983, after
Oracle Version 2, Oracle introduced its first multi-user version of the database, Oracle Version 3.
In 1985, Oracle 4 was released and included support for stored procedures, triggers, and four-level undo/redo logging.
In 1989 Oracle 5 was released, which was the first version of the database to feature online backup and recovery. In
1992, Oracle 6 was released, which introduced support for advanced replication, triggers, and distributed transactions.
In 1995, Oracle 7 was released, which introduced support for PL/SQL, an object-relational extension of SQL for stored
procedures and advanced programming. In 1997, Oracle 8 was released, which provided support for Java and the Internet.
Oracle 8i was the first version of the database to provide web access and featured integration with the Oracle
Application Server for development and deployment of web applications.
In 2003, Oracle 10g was released, featuring improved performance, scalability, and reliability. Oracle 11g was released
in 2007 with features such as partitioning, advanced compression, and query optimization. The current version of Oracle
Database, Oracle 18c, was released in 2018 and offers enhanced performance, scalability, reliability, and security.

-- Create index

CREATE INDEX last_name_index ON customers (last_name);

-- Insert values

INSERT INTO customers
    (customer_id, first_name, last_name, address, city, state, zip_code)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Smith', '123 Main St', 'Oakland', 'CA', '94607');

```
CREATE PROCEDURE INSERT_DATA (name VARCHAR2, age NUMBER)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO MyTable(Name, Age) VALUES (name, age);
END;
```

And here is an example of a SELECT query:

```
SELECT * 
FROM MyTable
WHERE Age > 20
