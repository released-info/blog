# Introduction

Linux Manjaro is a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux. It is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use, open
source platform that makes it simple to install and use the most popular applications. It can be used in both commercial
and personal projects. Manjaro is available in a number of different options, including a live CD, an installation image
and dual-boot images.

# History

Linux Manjaro was created in April 2011 by a group of developers who wanted to create a user-friendly, open source Linux
system. Since then, the project has grown exponentially in popularity and is now one of the most popular Linux
distributions. It has been used to power many commercial projects, and it is well-supported by many developers and
organizations. The developers have continued to improve the system and make it easier for users to install and use.

```
podman run <image_name>
```

### Creating User Accounts

User accounts in Linux Manjaro can be created and managed using the `useradd` command. For example, if you wanted to
create a new user account, you would use the following command:

```
sudo useradd <username>
```

The following code example shows how to install the Manjaro distribution on your computer:

```
# 1. Download the Manjaro ISO

# 3. Boot from the USB or DVD 
boot from: x:

# 4. Select the Manjaro installation option
# 5. Follow the on-screen instructions 
# 6. Reboot your computer after installation
```

Once Manjaro is installed, you can use the Pacman package manager to install any applications or packages available for
Manjaro. For example, if you wanted to install the Firefox web browser, you would type the following command into the
