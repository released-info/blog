# Microsoft SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is a database management system (DBMS) that is designed to store and manage large amounts of data. It is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. Microsoft SQL Server is developed and marketed by Microsoft, and is the most widely used database in enterprise environments today. It can be used to store, organize, and access data from many different sources, including online applications, on-premises applications, web services, Reporting Services, and more.

## History

Microsoft SQL Server has been around since 1989, and was initially based on the Sybase SQL Server 4.2 database engine. Microsoft licensed the engine and then developed a version of it to become Microsoft SQL Server 6.0, released in 1995. Over the years, Microsoft has added additional features to the product, and in 2017 released Microsoft SQL Server 2017.
Microsoft SQL Server was originally released in 1989 as a tandem offering with Microsoft OS/2. It was primarily developed as an enterprise-level relational database system, providing functionality that allowed users to store and manage their data in an organized, secure far more efficient way than the traditional file-based approach.
As relational databases found increasing use in enterprises, Microsoft continued developing the product, adding new features and capabilities. In 1994, Microsoft released version 6.0, which included support for stored procedures, triggers, and advanced data types, such as XML and long text fields.
In 1998, Microsoft released Version 7.0, which included support for replication and distributed queries, as well as OLAP cubes. This was followed by Version 8.0 in 2000, which featured improved scalability and performance and the addition of OLAP Services.
SQL Server 2005 was the biggest update to the product since its inception, introducing features such as user-defined functions, better management tools, and XML support. The release also debuted the first version of the now-standard SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
SQL Server 2008 saw the introduction of the transactional replication feature, which allows users to replicate data between multiple SQL Server databases. SQL Server 2012 ushered in the era of cloud-first databases, allowing users to deploy databases on Azure and Amazon Web Services. SQL Server 2016 introduced Always Encrypted, a feature that allows users to securely store and access encrypted data. The latest version, SQL Server 2019, adds features such as accelerated database recovery, automated tuning, and enhanced security features.

## Code Examples

### Sample Database Creation

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

This statement creates a new database named **testdb**.

### Table Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers
(
    customer_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
); 
```

This statement creates a table named `customers` with three columns: `customer_id`, `name`, and `email`.

### Inserting Data

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email)
VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com');
```

This statement inserts data into the `customers` table. The data inserted is a record for the customer with `customer_id` 1, `name` John Smith, and `email` john@example.com.

### Querying Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

This statement retrieves all data from the `customers` table for the customer with `customer_id` 1.


### Create Table
This example creates a simple table with two columns - id and name.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable ( 
  id INT, 
  name VARCHAR(50) 
); 
```

### Insert Data
This example inserts a row into the mytable table.

```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (id, name) 
VALUES (1, 'John');
```

### Select Data
This example selects all rows from the mytable table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable; 
```

### Update Data
This example updates the name column for id = 1.

```sql
UPDATE mytable 
SET name = 'John Doe' 
WHERE id = 1; 
```

### Delete Data
This example deletes the row where id = 1.

```sql
DELETE FROM mytable 
WHERE id = 1; 
```

### Simple Query

This example shows how to write a simple query using Microsoft SQL Server. 

```
SELECT * 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Stored Procedure

This example shows how to create a stored procedure using Microsoft SQL Server. 

```
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[procedure_name]
AS
BEGIN
   -- code here
END
GO
```

```

The following is an example of a SQL query used to select data from a table in a SQL Server database:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Customers 
WHERE Country = 'USA' 
AND Age > 30;
```
This query will retrieve all records from the Customers table where the Country field is equal to ‘USA’ and the Age field is greater than 30.
