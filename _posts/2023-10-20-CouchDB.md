        CouchDB is an open source, NoSQL database designed for scalability and resilience. It uses JSON documents to store data with an HTTP API for easy access. CouchDB is written in the Erlang programming language and allows for distributed computing. It also offers built-in replication for both one-to-one and master/slave synchronization of data. It is designed for developers looking for an alternative to popular SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, who require scalability and reliability without sacrificing the basic principles of data storage.
        CouchDB was first released in 2005 by the Apache Software Foundation and is based on the work of Damien Katz and the original CouchDB project. The team behind the project set out to create a non-relational, document-oriented database that could expand with ease and be read-writable over the web at any size.
        The initial version of CouchDB had some features that set it apart from other databases at the time, such as its ability to index any data field in the JSON documents stored in the database, which allowed for faster retrieval times. Its ability to replicate across multiple servers was a huge benefit as well, making it ideal for applications that needed to be constantly available.
        Since its initial release, CouchDB has gone on to become one of the most widely used NoSQL databases in the world. It has been adopted by some of the largest companies in the world, including Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo!, and is currently developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

# Introduction to CouchDB

CouchDB is an open-source document-oriented database written in the Erlang programming language. It was created by
Damien Katz in 2005 and released under the Apache License.
CouchDB stores data in JSON documents, and allows users to access, query, and manipulate the data through a RESTful HTTP
API. The same API can also be used to view and modify documents directly from any web browser.
CouchDB is often used as a tool for large-scale data storage, synchronization, and replication applications. It’s
popular among mobile developers and web application developers who need to store and sync their data between different
devices, services, or platforms.

## History of CouchDB

CouchDB was first released in 2005 by Damien Katz. Initially, the database was known as Lotus Notes Cloud Database, but
due to a trademark issue it was changed to Couch. Since its initial release, CouchDB has been adopted by major companies
like IBM, Oracle, Google, Microsoft and many more
The latest version of CouchDB as of 2020 is version 2.3.1 and it supports multiple OS i.e. Linux, OSX, and Windows.

## Features of CouchDB

CouchDB includes several features that make it unique.

• Document Storage: CouchDB stores its data in JSON documents, which makes it easier to access and manipulate data.
• Replication: CouchDB supports replication, which allows users to keep multiple copies of their data in different
locations. This helps keep data safe in case of disasters or outages.
• Data Synchronization: CouchDB includes a feature called “data synchronization” which allows users to keep their data
synchronized across multiple devices and services.
• HTTP API: CouchDB includes an easy-to-use HTTP API that can be used to access, query, and manipulate documents
directly from any web browser.
• MapReduce Queries: CouchDB can run MapReduce queries to quickly retrieve and analyze large amounts of data.

## Adoption

CouchDB is often used by developers to create web and mobile applications that require large amounts of data storage,
synchronization, and replication. Here are some examples of how CouchDB can be used in real-world applications.

• Mobile Apps: CouchDB is popular among mobile developers for synchronizing data between different devices. By using
CouchDB, developers can build apps that keep data synchronized across multiple devices.
• Web Applications: Web developers often use CouchDB to store and access large amounts of data. The easy-to-use HTTP API
allows developers to quickly query and manipulate documents directly from any web browser.
• Analytics: MapReduce queries allow developers to quickly analyze large amounts of data stored in CouchDB. This is
useful for applications that need to generate reports or aggregate data from multiple sources.

Here are some examples of how to use CouchDB in code.

To add data to a CouchDB database, you can use the “PUT” command. For example:

```
curl -X PUT http://url/database/doc_id \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{ "name": "John Doe", "age": 20 }'
```

To edit data in a CouchDB database, you can use the “POST” command. For example:

```
curl -X POST http://url/database/doc_id \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{ "name": "Jane Doe", "age": 21 }'
```

To retrieve data from a CouchDB database, you can use the “GET” command. For example:

```
curl -X GET http://url/database/doc_id
```

To delete data from a CouchDB database, you can use the “DELETE” command. For example:

```
curl -X DELETE http://url/database/doc_id
```

### Creating a Document

This example creates a new document with the specified id, fields, and values:

```javascript
PUT / database / _id
{
    "field1"
:
    "value1",
        "field2"
:
    "value2"
}
```
