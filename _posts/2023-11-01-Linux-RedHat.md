## Introduction to Linux Red Hat

Linux Red Hat is a Linux-based operating system developed by Red Hat, Inc. It is one of the most popular distributions
of Linux, with millions of users worldwide. Linux Red Hat is an open source software with many different versions
available, including Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
Linux RedHat is an open source project that contains the Linux kernel and a vast array of applications, tools and
services. It is a multi-user, multitasking operating system that allows multiple users to connect and share resources
through a network. It is widely used in many industries and across different countries.
Linux RedHat offers powerful command line utilities, scripting capabilities, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is
highly customizable, allowing users to choose from a range of packages, applications, and settings. It is also free to
download and use, making it an attractive option for many people.

# History of Linux RedHat

Linux RedHat is an open source operating system that is based on the Linux kernel and has been developed by the Linux
community. It was founded in 1993 and has since become one of the most popular Linux distributions. RedHat is known for
its stability and its extensive set of tools and applications.
RedHat was first released in 1994, based on the Linux kernel version 0.99. Its original goal was to provide a basic,
user-friendly Linux system. Over the years, it has evolved into a more complete operating system, with a large set of
packages, applications, and tools.
The most common distributions of RedHat are Fedora and RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), both of which are available for
free download. Fedora is the popular desktop version of RedHat, while RHEL is the enterprise-level distribution. Fedora
is the most up-to-date version, but RHEL is the most stable and secure.
RedHat's package-management system, RPM (Red Hat Package Manager), is used to install, update, and remove packages from
the system. The yum command is used to search and download packages from remote repositories. Another popular feature of
RedHat is SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux), which provides additional security features to the system.
RedHat also ships with a graphical package manager, called Pirut or Pup, which allows users to browse and install
packages from a GUI. The graphical package manager can also be used to search for packages and view dependencies.
One of the most powerful features of RedHat is its ability to customize the system. It is easy to create custom RPM
packages and bundles to tailor the system to the user's needs. RedHat also provides several GUI tools to help with
customization, such as the Anaconda Installer.
Since its inception, RedHat has been the leader in Linux server and cloud software. It is the most popular choice for
servers and large-scale deployments. RedHat provides several APIs, including the Red Hat Network, which is used to
manage and configure RedHat systems.
RedHat also has a number of software packages and programs designed to make system administration easier. These include
Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Nagios. There are also several GUI tools available, such as SystemAdm, WebMin, and cPanel.
RedHat is also the leading choice for embedded systems. RedHat Embedded Linux is the most popular solution for embedded
systems, such as electronic devices, wearables, and IoT devices. It includes an embedded real-time operating system,
along with an extensive set of libraries and drivers.
In addition to its core functionality, RedHat also provides a range of additional services and software. These range
from support for development environments, to authentication and authorization services, to a rich set of command line
tools.
Overall, RedHat is one of the most popular and widely used Linux distributions. It is well known for its stability,
extensive library of tools and applications, and wide range of customization options. It is used widely in servers, in
the cloud, and in embedded systems, making it an essential component of any IT infrastructure.

## Features of Linux Red Hat

Linux Red Hat is a powerful and flexible operating system with many features and advantages. Its security features
include access control, firewalls, virtualization, cryptography, and system auditing. It also has many robust
applications and tools that are designed to run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems, such as the Apache Web
Server, MySQL database, and OpenSSH client.
Linux Red Hat also offers a wide range of interoperability options between different software and hardware platforms.
This includes support for different file systems, networking protocols, package managers, and scripting languages, as
well as compatibility with different architectures and distributions.

## Usages of Linux Red Hat

Linux Red Hat is used in many different fields and industries, including web servers, cloud computing, application
development, and enterprise computing. It is also used by businesses and organizations of all sizes, from small startups
to large companies.

One of the most common uses of Linux Red Hat is as a secure platform for web servers. Many websites are hosted on
servers running Linux Red Hat, including Wikipedia, Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It is also frequently used for cloud
computing, providing a secure and reliable environment for hosting applications and services.

Linux Red Hat is also used for application development. It provides a secure and reliable platform for developing
applications and services that are scalable, secure, and reliable. It is also used for enterprise computing, providing
an efficient and secure environment for managing and running business applications.

## Code Examples

Here is an example of how to compile a simple hello world program using gcc on Linux Red Hat:

```
$ gcc -o hello hello.c 
$ ./hello 
Hello World!
```

Here is an example of how to install Apache web server on Linux Red Hat:

```
$ sudo yum update 
$ sudo yum install httpd 
$ sudo systemctl start httpd 
$ sudo systemctl enable httpd 
```

Here is an example of how to install MySQL on Linux Red Hat:

```
$ sudo yum install mysql-server 
$ sudo systemctl start mysqld 
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

### Create a new user

`useradd -m username -s /bin/bash`

The command above will create a new user with the given username and default shell.

### Update the system

`yum update -y`

The command above will update the system to the latest version.

### Install a package

`yum install <package-name> -y`

The command above will install a specified package.

### Delete a user

`userdel -r username`

The command above will delete a user from the system and any files associated with it.

### List running processes

`ps -e`

The command above will list all the running processes on the system.

### Shut down the system

`shutdown -h now`

The command above will shut down the server immediately.

## Example Code

The following example shows a simple hello world program written in C and compiled with GCC on RedHat:

```
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   printf("Hello, World!\n");
   return 0;
}
```

To compile the program, you can use the following command on RedHat:

```
gcc hello.c -o hello
```

This will create an executable file called `hello`. To run it, you can use the following command:

```
./hello
```

This will print out the message `Hello, World!`.
