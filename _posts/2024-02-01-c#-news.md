# Exploring the Latest Features in C#

## Introduction
C# continues to evolve, bringing new features that enhance performance, security, and developer productivity. In this post, we'll explore some of the most exciting additions to recent C# versions and how they impact modern development.

# Past two years

Over the past two years, the C# programming language has seen significant advancements with the release of versions 12 and 13, each introducing features aimed at enhancing developer productivity and code efficiency.

## C# 12 (November 2023):

Released in conjunction with .NET 8, C# 12 brought several notable features:

- **Primary Constructors:** This feature allows developers to define constructor parameters directly within the class declaration, streamlining the initialization process.

- **Collection Expressions:** Simplifying the creation and manipulation of collections, this addition enhances code readability and reduces boilerplate code.

- **Inline Arrays:** Developers can now define arrays directly within expressions, leading to more concise and readable code.

- **Optional Parameters in Lambdas:** This enhancement allows lambda expressions to have optional parameters, increasing their flexibility and usability.

## C# 13 (November 2024):

Building upon its predecessors, C# 13, released alongside .NET 9, introduced the following features:

- **Params Collections:** The `params` modifier is no longer limited to array types; it can now be used with any recognized collection type, including `Span&lt;T&gt;` and interface types, providing greater flexibility in method parameter definitions.

- **New Lock Type and Semantics:** If the target of a `lock` statement is a `System.Threading.Lock`, the compiler generates code to use the `Lock.EnterScope()` method to enter an exclusive scope, offering more granular control over synchronization.

- **Field Keyword (Preview Feature):** The introduction of the `field` keyword allows for more explicit references to backing fields within property accessors. It's important to note that this is a preview feature in C# 13 and requires enabling the preview language version in your project settings.

# C# enhancements

These enhancements reflect Microsoft's commitment to evolving C# in ways that address modern development needs, emphasizing simplicity, performance, and developer productivity.

## 1. Record Types
C# introduced **record types** to simplify immutable data structures and reduce boilerplate code.
```csharp
public record Person(string Name, int Age);
```
Records provide built-in value-based equality and with-expressions for easy modifications.

## 2. Pattern Matching Enhancements
Pattern matching has been significantly improved in recent C# versions.

### Key Updates:
- **Relational Patterns**
- **Logical Patterns (and, or, not)**
- **Type Patterns with `switch` Expressions**

#### Example:
```csharp
int number = 42;
string result = number switch
{
    > 0 => "Positive",
    < 0 => "Negative",
    _ => "Zero"
};
```

## 3. File-Scoped Namespaces
A cleaner way to define namespaces without unnecessary indentation.
```csharp
namespace MyApp;

class Program
{
    static void Main() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, C#");
}
```

## 4. Required Properties
Introduced in C# 11, **required properties** enforce initialization of certain fields.
```csharp
public class User
{
    public required string Name { get; init; }
}
```

## 5. Null Parameter Checking
C# 11 introduces a concise way to enforce non-null parameters.
```csharp
public void PrintMessage(string message!!)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message);
}
```

## 6. Raw String Literals
C# 11 adds **raw string literals**, making it easier to define multi-line strings.
```csharp
string json = """
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30
}
""";
```

## 7. Performance Improvements with Span&lt;T&gt;
C# continues to improve memory efficiency with Span&lt;T&gt; and Memory&lt;T&gt;.
```csharp
Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
```

## Conclusion
These new features in C# improve performance, readability, and efficiency, making C# more modern and developer-friendly. Keeping up with these updates ensures better coding practices and optimized applications.
