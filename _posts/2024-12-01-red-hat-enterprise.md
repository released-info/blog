# Understanding Red Hat Enterprise Linux Naming Conventions and Versions

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is one of the most widely used enterprise-grade Linux distributions, providing stability, security, and long-term support for critical business applications. However, many people, especially those new to Red Hat, often struggle with naming conventions and versioning. A common mistake is referring to RHEL versions incorrectly, such as "Linux RedHat 10" instead of the proper "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10."

This article clarifies the correct naming conventions for RHEL and provides an overview of its version history.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Naming Conventions

Red Hat follows a structured naming convention for its Linux distribution to maintain consistency and clarity:

- **Correct Name:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- **Incorrect Variations:**
  - RedHat Linux (this refers to the older, discontinued Red Hat Linux project)
  - RedHat Enterprise 10 (misses "Linux")
  - Linux RedHat 10 (incorrect word order)

The correct format always includes "Red Hat Enterprise Linux" followed by the version number, such as **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8** or **RHEL 9** (a commonly accepted shorthand).

## A Brief History of Red Hat Versions

Red Hat Linux was the original open-source distribution from Red Hat Inc., launched in the mid-1990s. In 2003, Red Hat transitioned to an enterprise-focused model, leading to the introduction of **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** as a commercially supported distribution with long-term stability and security updates.

### Major RHEL Versions and Key Features

#### RHEL 3 (2003 – 2010)
- Introduced a new enterprise-oriented lifecycle.
- Enhanced security and scalability for enterprise workloads.

#### RHEL 4 (2005 – 2017)
- First release to support SELinux by default.
- Introduced Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) for better performance.

#### RHEL 5 (2007 – 2020)
- Improved virtualization with built-in Xen hypervisor.
- Enhanced security and file system support.

#### RHEL 6 (2010 – 2024, with Extended Lifecycle Support - ELS)
- Switched to KVM for virtualization.
- Introduced ext4 file system and improved power management.

#### RHEL 7 (2014 – 2026, ELS available)
- Adopted **systemd** as the default init system.
- Defaulted to XFS as the primary file system.
- Introduced Docker container support.

#### RHEL 8 (2019 – 2029, ELS available)
- Introduced **AppStreams** for software module management.
- Switched from YUM to **DNF** for package management.
- Provided enhanced container support with **Podman**.

#### RHEL 9 (2022 – 2032)

#### **RHEL 10 (Future Release)**
While not officially announced, Red Hat is expected to continue its tradition of innovation in **RHEL 10**,
focusing on **AI workloads, security enhancements, automation, and cloud-native optimizations**.

## Understanding RHEL Support Lifecycle

Red Hat provides **up to 10 years of support** for each major RHEL version, divided into:

1. **Full Support (5 years)** – New features, hardware support, and security updates.
2. **Maintenance Support (5 years)** – Critical security fixes and maintenance updates.
3. **Extended Lifecycle Support (optional beyond 10 years)** – Available as an add-on for critical workloads.

# Why "Linux RedHat 10" Is Incorrect and Should Be "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10"

The phrase **"Linux RedHat 10"** is incorrect for several reasons, primarily related to Red Hat's official naming conventions and branding.

1. **Incorrect Brand Name Order**
   "Linux RedHat 10" suggests that "RedHat" is a product under the "Linux" umbrella, which is misleading. **Red Hat** is the company that develops and maintains Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which is a specific Linux distribution. The correct format should reflect this hierarchy.

2. **Missing "Enterprise" in the Name**
   The official name of the operating system is **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**. Simply calling it "RedHat 10" omits the "Enterprise" designation, which is crucial because Red Hat also offers other products, including Fedora and CentOS Stream.

3. **Spacing and Capitalization Issues**
   The correct name is **Red Hat**, with a space between "Red" and "Hat." It should never be written as "RedHat" without the space, as this does not align with Red Hat’s official branding.

4. **Version Numbering Accuracy**
   Red Hat follows a structured versioning system. The correct way to reference a specific release would be **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 (RHEL 10)** rather than "Linux RedHat 10."

### Correct Naming
✅ **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10**
✅ **RHEL 10** (acceptable abbreviation in technical contexts)

By using the proper name, you ensure clarity, professionalism, and alignment with Red Hat’s official branding.

## Conclusion

Understanding Red Hat Enterprise Linux’s naming conventions and versioning ensures clarity when discussing or implementing RHEL in an enterprise environment.
Always use the correct format—**Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) X**—to avoid confusion.
With each new version, Red Hat continues to innovate, providing businesses with a secure and scalable platform for modern IT infrastructures.
