        Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is widely used in enterprise environments where security and stability are top priorities. RHEL provides a robust security framework, including mandatory access controls, vulnerability scanning, and compliance tools. This article explores the key security features in RHEL and best practices for securing enterprise deployments.

# Exploring the Latest Features in Java

## Introduction
Java continues to evolve, bringing new features that enhance performance, security, and developer productivity. In this post, we'll explore some of the most exciting additions to recent Java versions and how they impact modern development.

## 1. Pattern Matching Enhancements
Pattern matching has been evolving in Java, making code more readable and reducing boilerplate.

### Key Updates:
- **Pattern Matching for `instanceof`** (Introduced in Java 16)
- **Record Patterns** (Preview in Java 19, Improves destructuring of records)
- **Switch Pattern Matching** (Refined in Java 21)

#### Example:
```java
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

## 2. Records and Sealed Classes
### Records
Records simplify immutable data carriers, reducing boilerplate associated with traditional Java beans.
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

### Sealed Classes
Sealed Classes (Introduced in Java 17) allow better control over class hierarchies:
```java
sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}
final class Circle extends Shape {}
final class Rectangle extends Shape {}
```

## 3. Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
Introduced in **Java 21**, Virtual Threads revolutionize concurrency by enabling lightweight thread creation, reducing resource consumption.
```java
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello from a virtual thread"));
}
```

## 4. Foreign Function & Memory API
Java has improved interoperability with native code using the **Foreign Function & Memory API**.

### Use Case:
Interfacing with C libraries without JNI complexity.
```java
try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(100);
}
```

## 5. String Templates (Preview in Java 21)
String Templates simplify concatenation and formatting:
```java
String name = "Alice";
String greeting = STR."Hello, \{name}!";
```

## Conclusion
These new features in Java improve performance, readability, and efficiency, making Java more modern and developer-friendly. Keeping up with these updates ensures better coding practices and optimized applications.
